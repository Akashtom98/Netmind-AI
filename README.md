# 🧠 NetMind AI — Network Security Copilot

**NetMind AI** is an AI-powered **Network Log Analysis Dashboard** that simulates how modern LLMs like Claude or GPT can detect, visualize, and remediate security threats in real time.

Built entirely with **React, TailwindCSS, and Recharts**, it transforms raw **Cisco ASA/FTD firewall logs** into rich insights — helping network engineers and security teams understand attacks faster and respond smarter.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **AI Threat Analysis**
  - Simulates intelligent log parsing to identify brute-force, ICMP scans, and anomalous patterns.
- 🛡️ **Incident Insights**
  - Generates detailed descriptions, attack sources, and recommended actions.
- 📊 **Interactive Visualizations**
  - Event Distribution, Timeline Trends, and Top Attacker IPs using Recharts.
- ⚙️ **Auto Remediation**
  - Suggests CLI commands for immediate firewall mitigation.
- 🎨 **Sleek Modern UI**
  - TailwindCSS + Lucide Icons + Gradient design for an enterprise-grade look.

## 📖 Project Story

This project started as an idea:  
> “What if I could build an AI Copilot for network engineers — one that *reads logs like an analyst* and *responds like an expert*?”

As a **Network Security Engineer**, I’ve worked hands-on with Cisco ASA/FTD firewalls and log analysis tools.  
While logs reveal everything, they’re **painfully time-consuming** to interpret.

So I built **NetMind AI**, an experimental prototype that simulates how an **AI assistant** could transform security operations — from detection to remediation — in a single, unified dashboard.

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

| Layer | Tools / Frameworks |
|-------|--------------------|
| **Frontend** | React (TypeScript) |
| **UI/UX** | TailwindCSS, Lucide React |
| **Charts & Graphs** | Recharts |
| **AI Simulation** | Mocked Claude AI Output (future: API integration) |
| **Hosting (Future)** | Vercel / Netlify |

## 🧩 Key Learning Highlights

1. **Log Intelligence Design** — Learned how to transform structured ASA/FTD syslog data into meaningful event groupings.  
2. **Data Visualization** — Implemented responsive Pie, Line, and Bar charts to present threat data effectively.  
3. **AI Workflow Simulation** — Designed mock AI pipelines for threat detection, summarization, and remediation logic.  
4. **User-Centric Security UX** — Focused on clarity, urgency, and actionable insights — core to SOC dashboards.  
5. **Scalability Mindset** — Architected components that can later plug into real AI APIs (Claude / OpenAI).
